/**
 * Configuration details for managing client connections.
 *
 * @property host The hostname or IP address of the server to connect to.
 * @property port The port number used for establishing the connection.
 * @property protocol The protocol used for the connection, such as "http" or "https".
 * @property headers A map of custom headers to include with each request.
 * @property reconnectionDelay An optional delay duration before attempting to reconnect after a connection loss.
 * @property requestTimeout The maximum duration to wait for an individual HTTP request to complete.
 *                          Defaults to 5 seconds.
 * @property connectTimeout The maximum duration to wait while establishing a connection to the server.
 *                          Defaults to 15 seconds.
 *
 * @property url A computed property that constructs the base URL for this connection

 * @property sseUrl A computed property that constructs the URL endpoint for Server-Sent Events (SSE).
 * @property healthCheckUrl A computed property that constructs the URL endpoint for health check requests.
 * @property messageUrl A computed property that constructs the URL endpoint for sending or receiving messages.
