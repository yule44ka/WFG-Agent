 * - Generating timestamps for memory chunks and facts
 * - Implementing time-based memory retrieval and cleanup
 * - Supporting temporal reasoning in the memory system
 * - Enabling platform-specific time handling optimizations
 *
 * The interface is designed to be simple yet flexible enough to accommodate
