/**
 * File-based implementation of [AgentMemoryProvider] that provides persistent storage of agent memory
 * using a hierarchical file system structure. This implementation is designed for durability,
 * thread safety, and human readability of stored data.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Thread-safe operations using mutex locks
 * - Hierarchical storage structure for efficient organization
 * - JSON-based storage with pretty printing for human readability
 * - Support for multiple memory scopes and subjects
 * - Atomic read/write operations
 *
 * Storage Structure:
 * ```
 * root/
 *   storageDirectory/
 *     agent/                    # For MemoryScope.Agent
 *       [agent-name]/
 *         subject/
 *           [subject-name]/
 *             facts.json
 *     feature/                  # For MemoryScope.Feature
 *       [feature-id]/
 *         subject/
 *           [subject-name]/
 *             facts.json
 *     product/                  # For MemoryScope.Product
 *       [product-name]/
 *         subject/
 *           [subject-name]/
 *             facts.json
 *     organization/             # For MemoryScope.CrossProduct
 *       subject/
 *         [subject-name]/
 *           facts.json
 * ```
 *
 * Usage example:
 * ```
 * val provider = LocalFileMemoryProvider(
 *     config = LocalMemoryConfig("memory-storage"),
 *     storage = EncryptedStorage(fileSystem),
 *     fs = JVMFileSystemProvider,
 *     root = Path("path/to/root")
 * )
 *
 * // Store environment information
 * provider.save(
 *     fact = environmentFact,
 *     subject = MemorySubject.Machine,
 *     scope = MemoryScope.Agent("env-analyzer")
 * )
 *
 * // Retrieve project dependencies
 * val dependencies = provider.load(
 *     concept = dependenciesConcept,
 *     subject = MemorySubject.Project,
 *     scope = MemoryScope.Product("my-product")
 * )
 * ```

 * @property config Configuration for local storage including base directory and options
 * @property storage Implementation of storage operations (can be encrypted or plain)
 * @property fs Platform-specific file system provider for path manipulations
