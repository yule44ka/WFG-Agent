## Overview of Gemini Flash 2.0

Gemini Flash 2.0 is a high-speed, multimodal generative model with a massive context window, native tool use, and
advanced chain-of-thought (CoT) capabilities. It’s engineered for both everyday language tasks and more complex, agentic
applications. Its strengths include:

- **Low latency & high throughput:** Ideal for real-time applications.
- **Multimodal input/output:** Supports text (and experimental image generation).
- **Advanced reasoning:** With the optional Flash Thinking mode, it can display its internal reasoning steps.
- **Agentic capabilities:** Designed to plan, act, and self-reflect, enabling autonomous task execution under user
  supervision.

## General Prompting Guidelines

When crafting prompts for typical queries or structured tasks, consider the following:

1. **Clarity & Specificity:**
    - State your task explicitly using direct, natural language.
    - **Example:**
      > "Summarize the following article in one concise sentence, avoiding technical jargon."

2. **Be Concise**
   - Gemini Flash 2.0 provides better results when not overloaded with template prompt

3. **Context Provision:**
    - Provide necessary background or context to guide the model’s response.
    - If asking for an explanation or summarization, include the relevant text clearly demarcated.

4. **Few-Shot Examples:**
    - Use examples when the desired output format isn’t obvious.
    - **Example (for sentiment classification):**
      ```
      Text: "I am thrilled with the service."
      Sentiment: joy
 
      Text: "I am disappointed with the product."
      Sentiment: sadness
 
      Text: "The experience was average."
      Sentiment:
      ```

5. **Adjustable Parameters:**
    - Experiment with settings such as temperature, top-p, and maximum token limits to balance creativity with
      precision.
    - Start with moderate values (e.g., temperature around 0.2–0.3) and tune based on task complexity.

These practices help ensure Gemini Flash 2.0 produces clear, accurate, and contextually appropriate responses for
standard queries.

## Agentic Prompting Guidelines

Agentic prompts are designed to trigger Gemini Flash 2.0’s autonomous, multi-step reasoning and planning capabilities.
Use these when you require the model to:

- **Plan and Execute:** Break down a complex task into sub-tasks, decide which tools or steps to use, and then execute
  actions accordingly.
- **Self-Reflect:** Evaluate intermediate outputs and adjust the approach if needed.

### Key Strategies for Agentic Prompts:

1. **Define a Clear Goal:**
    - Clearly state the objective so the model understands it must not only answer a query but also plan and act.
    - **Example:**
      > "You are an AI agent whose goal is to create a travel itinerary for a 3-day trip to Paris. Outline your plan,
      list key attractions, and suggest a sample schedule."

2. **Explicit Instruction for Reasoning:**
    - Instruct the model to reveal its chain-of-thought if needed, while ensuring that internal reasoning tags are not
      included in the final answer.
    - **Example:**
      > "Before providing your final itinerary, briefly outline your planning steps using internal tags (do not include
      these tags in your final response)."

3. **Iterative Self-Reflection:**
    - For multi-step tasks, prompt the model to review and refine its responses.
    - **Example:**
      > "After drafting the itinerary, analyze it for any missing details or inconsistencies, and then present a revised
      version."

4. **Tool and Function Integration:**
    - If the task involves interacting with external tools (e.g., search, image generation), clearly indicate when and
      how to call these functions.
    - **Example:**
      > "If you need current weather information for Paris, indicate that you will fetch it via the Google Search tool
      before finalizing your schedule."

5. **Tagging for Structured Thought (Optional):**
    - Advanced users may use internal tagging (e.g., `<deconstruction>`, `<structure>`, `<draft>`, `<critique>`) to
      structure internal reasoning.
    - **Note:** These tags should only organize your chain-of-thought and must be excluded from the final output.

Using these strategies enables Gemini Flash 2.0 to function as an autonomous agent that plans, executes, and
self-corrects complex tasks.

## Model-Specific Considerations for Gemini Flash 2.0

1. **Multimodal Capabilities:**
    - Specify the modalities when necessary. For example, if an image is to be generated, mention “generate an image” or
      “create a caption for this image.”

2. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Flash Thinking:**
    - While Gemini Flash 2.0 can show its reasoning process, overusing explicit “think step by step” phrases may not
      always be beneficial. Experiment with succinct versus detailed reasoning prompts based on task complexity.
    - Some tasks may benefit from brief internal reasoning (flash thinking), while others may require a more in-depth
      breakdown.

3. **Agentic Behavior vs. General Querying:**
    - For general tasks, avoid overloading the prompt with agentic instructions unless necessary. Keep it simple and
      direct.
    - For agentic tasks, structure your prompt to include phases of planning, execution, and reflection.

4. **Iteration and Self-Consistency:**
    - Encourage iterative improvement by prompting the model to re-evaluate its outputs, potentially through multiple
      passes.

## Advanced Techniques and Tips

- **Prompt Reordering:**  
  Experiment with the order of context, examples, and questions. Sometimes placing examples before the question can
  yield better results.

- **Parameter Tuning:**  
  Adjust temperature, top-k, and top-p settings based on whether you desire more deterministic or creative responses.

- **Feedback Loops:**  
  For highly complex or critical tasks, include instructions for the model to compare its initial draft with subsequent
  drafts and choose the most consistent answer.

- **Testing and Iteration:**  
  Continuously test your prompts with small variations. Gemini Flash 2.0, like other LLMs, may respond differently based
  on slight changes in phrasing or context.

## Conclusion

By applying these guidelines, you can effectively leverage Gemini Flash 2.0’s robust general capabilities and its
specialized agentic functions. Whether handling standard summarization tasks or building autonomous AI agents that plan,
act, and self-reflect, these practices help maximize performance and reliability. Experimentation and iteration are
key—adjust your prompts based on observed outcomes to continually improve your interactions with the model.

These guidelines serve as a practical framework for developing effective, context-rich prompts that harness the full
power of Gemini Flash 2.0 in both general and agentic applications.
