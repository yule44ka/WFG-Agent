# Comprehensive Guide to Prompting o3-mini

OpenAI’s **o3-mini** is a specialized reasoning model optimized for STEM tasks—such as complex math, coding, and scientific analysis. Unlike many traditional language models, o3-mini performs internal reasoning (often called a “private chain of thought”) without needing explicit step-by-step instructions. This guide outlines best practices, common pitfalls, and advanced techniques to help you craft effective prompts.

## 1. Introduction

The o3-mini model offers:
- **Enhanced Reasoning:** It internally “thinks” through problems before producing an answer.
- **High Precision for Technical Tasks:** Excelling in mathematics, coding, and scientific queries.
- **Multiple Reasoning Effort Levels:** Options to set *low*, *medium*, or *high* effort depending on your task's complexity.

## 2. What Sets o3-mini Apart?

### Internal Reasoning
- **No Need for Explicit “Chain-of-Thought” Prompts:**  
  o3-mini automatically performs intermediate reasoning. There is no need to add phrases like “think step by step.”

### Task-Specific Tuning
- **Reasoning Effort Parameter:**  
  Adjust the model’s depth by setting the reasoning effort to low, medium, or high.

### Structured and Tool-Assisted Outputs
- **Output Format and Tool Calling:**  
  o3-mini supports clear output formatting and can even integrate with external tools (e.g., for fetching real-time data).

## 3. Best Practices for Prompting o3-mini

### Keep It Simple and Direct
- **Clear Instructions:**  
  State your task concisely. Avoid unnecessary background information or verbose language.  
  **Example:** Instead of “Please carefully analyze the following Python code and find the errors step by step,” use:
  > “Identify and correct errors in this Python code.”

- **Focused Prompts:**  
  Each prompt should have one clear goal.

### Avoid Unnecessary Chain-of-Thought Directives
- **Let o3-mini Reason Internally:**  
  Do not instruct the model to “explain every step.” Its internal reasoning is sufficient.

### Provide Specific Guidelines and Output Formats
- **Use Delimiters & Format Instructions:**  
  Specify if you need your answer in a particular format (e.g., JSON, bullet points, a tree view).

- **Set Constraints:**  
  Clearly state any limits, such as “limit your response to under 50 lines of code” or “return only the final answer in a numbered list.”

### Use Context Wisely
- **Include Only Essential Context:**  
  Provide only the necessary background or data to avoid distracting the model.

- **Structured Context Dumps:**  
  Organize any required context (e.g., case facts or dataset details) into clear sections or bullet lists.

## 4. Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques

### Controlling Reasoning Effort
- **Adjust the `reasoningEffort` Parameter:**  
  Use API or system settings to switch between low, medium, or high reasoning effort. High effort yields more detailed responses (with increased latency).

### Generating Structured Data & Using Tools
- **Structured Output:**  
  When you require a specific schema (e.g., a JSON object), instruct the model accordingly.

- **Tool Calling:**  
  Integrate tool calling for tasks that need external data (e.g., real-time weather).

### Iterative Refinement
- **Test and Iterate:**  
  If the output isn’t as expected, rephrase or adjust constraints in your prompt.

- **Feedback Loops:**  
  Consider breaking complex tasks into sequential prompts.

## 5. Example Prompts

### Example 1: Building a Python Application
```markdown
**Prompt:**
Build a Python app that maps user questions to answers stored in a database:
- When a question closely matches an existing entry, retrieve and display the answer.
- Otherwise, prompt the user to supply an answer and store the new Q&A pair.
- Provide a plan for the directory structure as a tree view.
- Return each file’s complete code with brief comments explaining key parts.
